PersonalMovieManager
====================

Personal Movie Manager is a movie managing software which can automatically
get a list of all movies on your computer and retrieve information about them
from http://www.omdbapi.com/

This is currently a work in progress and some features are yet to be implemented,
notably search and manually updating information.
The add movie, delete movie and play movie options work.
